            <p>Have you ever noticed how you become incredibly <i>action-biased</i> during times of pressure, like exams, but that same drive seems to vanish when the urgency is gone? I recently observed this in myself and started pondering why this happens. Where does all that motivation come from during exams, and where does it disappear afterward?</p>

            <p>This led me to an interesting theory.</p>
            
            <h2>The Nature of Boredom</h2>
            <p><i>Boredom</i> can be understood as a state of uncertainty, a moment when you don’t know what to do. It’s during this time that doubts creep in, and questions like <i>What am I doing with my life?</i> or <i>What’s my purpose?</i> begin to haunt us. The sheer number of possibilities often leaves us paralyzed, resulting in procrastination. Instead of acting, we spend our time imagining all the things we could do without actually doing anything.</p>

            <p>However, when we are forced into action like during exams, where external pressure compels us to study something we might find irrelevant. We get an unexpected clarity about what we don’t want to do. And paradoxically, it’s in avoiding these forced tasks that we often stumble upon things we find genuinely interesting.</p>

            <h2>Why Knowing What You Don’t Want Is Powerful</h2>
            <p>Knowing what you don’t want to do is often more useful than being stuck in complete indecision. These moments of enforced action shift our focus from endless overthinking to trying things without overanalyzing the outcome. This is the power of being <i>action-biased</i>. You simply start doing, and in the process, you discover new interests and passions.</p>

            <h2>Turning Uncertainty Into Progress</h2>
            <p>So, the next time boredom strikes and you feel unsure of what to do, think back to the last time you felt genuinely excited about something you did, even if it was spontaneous or unplanned. That spark might not reveal your ultimate calling, but it’s a clue. Use it to begin. The key is to embrace action over endless reflection.</p>

            <p>Don’t wait for perfect clarity. Instead, treat this process like climbing stairs, each step, even if it leads you away from what’s not for you, gets you closer to what truly resonates. By doing, you’ll move closer to that sweet spot where you find joy in the process itself.</p>

            <p>In the end, it’s not about having all the answers but about taking that first step. Trust the process, and let your curiosity guide the way.</p>
