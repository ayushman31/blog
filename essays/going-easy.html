            <p>I am now convinced that betting is a fool's game. Today, I didn't realize the "main" reason to not bet but the "best" reason.</p>

            <p>Getting money through betting can result in two kinds of attitudes: <i>"Damn I can "earn" so much money without doing anything, others are fools who work so hard."</i> OR <i>"If I can earn even this little bit without doing anything then what's the harm?".</i> The latter attitude settles you for less, settles you for mediocrity, makes you lazy.</p>

            <p>The former attitude, on the other hand, can result in 2 kinds of comparison. So basically, we can compare others to ourselves in two ways: first we downgrade ourselves, second we downgrade others. The most obvious comparison is the second one. But it wil also, in later point of life, become the first comparison. It will happen when you will finally earn your own hard earned money. You will never get the joy in earning x amount through hardwork if you have already earned 2x,3x,4x through other means. You will start downgrading yourself, which is the ultimate fate of a bettor.</p>

            <p>And this, can be applied to so many other aspects of life be it relationships, work, etc. So don't take the easy way. Cheers !!!</p>
