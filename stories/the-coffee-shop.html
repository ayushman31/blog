            <p>The coffee shop on Fifth Street had exactly seventeen tables, and Maya had counted them all during her first week of unemployment.</p>

            <p>She wasn't looking for work, exactly. She was looking for routine. Something to replace the rhythm of her old life - the 7 AM alarm, the crowded subway, the fluorescent-lit cubicle where she'd spent three years writing marketing copy for products she'd never use.</p>

            <h2>A Daily Ritual</h2>

            <p>Every morning at 9:15, she ordered the same thing: medium coffee, no sugar, and a blueberry muffin she never finished. She'd take the corner table by the window and pretend to read while actually watching the other customers.</p>

            <p>There was the businessman who always looked stressed, constantly checking his phone between sips of espresso. The elderly woman who brought a different book every day but seemed to read the same page over and over. The young mother who looked exhausted but smiled at everyone anyway.</p>

            <h2>The Regular</h2>

            <p>After two weeks, Maya realized she'd become a regular herself. The barista - a college student with paint-stained fingers - started preparing her order when she walked through the door.</p>

            <p>"Rough morning?" he asked one Tuesday, noticing her disheveled appearance.</p>

            <p>"Every morning is rough when you don't have anywhere to be," Maya replied, surprised by her own honesty.</p>

            <p>He paused, coffee pot in hand. "Maybe that's the point. Maybe rough mornings mean you're figuring something out."</p>

            <h2>Finding Purpose</h2>

            <p>Maya thought about this as she watched the businessman hurry out, phone pressed to his ear. She thought about it as the elderly woman carefully marked a passage in her book. She thought about it as the young mother juggled a toddler and a laptop, somehow managing both with grace.</p>

            <p>Everyone here was figuring something out.</p>

            <p>Maybe unemployment wasn't about finding her next job. Maybe it was about finding her next self.</p>

            <p>She opened her notebook and started writing - not marketing copy this time, but something that felt true. Outside the window, the city rushed by, but inside the coffee shop on Fifth Street, Maya had found her rhythm again.</p>
